Description
------------

This web-application is a game to take the best photos around the University of Exeter campus.  
Users take photos around campus fulfilling different criteria to complete challenges, which will have a large variety and can be daily, weekly, time-limited, special events etc.  
Points are rewarded for completing challenges and for winning them. Challenge winners can be decided by gamekeepers (admins) or through a user voting system.  
These points can be used to unlock stickers and tags to use on photos, as well as on weekly and all-time leaderboards showing who the most prominent photographers are.  
Photos can be viewed in the photo feed, which shows the latest and highest-rated photos for each live challenge.
